Hello Github World!

My curriculum vitae talks about my life in a schematic way with a view to arousing professional interest but the posts on this blog talk about me much more. My love of sailing, computing, literature, philosophy, politics, martial arts, cinema, theater and writing. But the emotion I put in certain posts tells a lot more about who I am and what I like.
